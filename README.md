## ANALYSIS:

### FAE AND FCE BY YEAR:
Here we see both FAE and FCE slowly rising year by year, with a dip during 2020-21. The dip was due to the pandemic but it rebounded. What can we infer from this?
- An increasing FAE and FCE suggest that the NHS is treating more patients, possibly due to medical advancements and organisational expansion, such as hiring more staff.
- Elective admissions have generally risen, indicating improved capacity to treat patients.
- Emergency admissions have also increased at a steady rate, reflecting greater reliance on emergency care, which could suggest a growing strain on NHS services.
- The dip during the pandemic was due to treatment delays, likely creating a backlog that may have impacted admissions in subsequent years.

### MALE AND FEMALE FCE BY AGE (2022-23):
- Both male and female FCE drop from the ages 0-4 to 5-9. The high FCE at 0-4 is highly likely due to new-borns and possibly unfortunate complications during this stage
- The lowest FCE count was at 10-14
